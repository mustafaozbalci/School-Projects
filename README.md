# Survey-Project
While doing this project, I aimed to make a general review and practice work on all the topics taught to us by the school throughout the semester.
During the completion of the project, I did a lot of internet research. I took help from many pages like Stackoverflow and turned the code into a successful application.
I made a loading screen, 3 different GUI pages and a Server Client connection.
